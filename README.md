# dcs-ew-up-displacement

This Developer Cloud Sandbox application provides an IDL based example of the extraction Vertical and East-West component of two InSAR measurements, one ascending and one descending thus providing two different Line-of-Sight (LOS) views.

This application can either be modified and extendend to process several ascending and descending InSAR measurements. 

### Scientific and technical challenge

Multi-angle and multi-resolution data combination is a not straightforward task. Different look angles along the scene, different resolutions, different time sampling and some assumptions on the ground reflector nature and position have to be considered. Participants will be provided with all the necessary information to accomplish the task in the best possible way. Effective implementations that exploit parallel procedures are positively evaluated.

### Challenge Description

The data challenge applicants have to reconstruct the 2D deformation field of a selected area by identifying the Vertical and East-West component of the displacement, given a set of InSAR time series generated through SBAS from different passes and different angles over the identified area.
